This project now includes some seperate executable files and one underlying
library supporting them.

The executable files are:

	HMesh:				a GUI program for mesh simplification, using Qt
	hoocsimp:			an out-of-core vertex clustering algorithm
	hspacedivision:		an R-Simp algorithm implementation
	patchingsimp:		a patch-based simplification for massive meshes
	quadircED:			a edge collapse framework for iterative simplification

While the functions differ, they actually invoke the same library called
'hsimpkit' and is an simple wrapping for the underlying algorithm implemented
in the library.

All projects and codes are written and tested under Windows/VS2005, using a
nVidia GeForce 9800GT or ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3400 graphics card. There is
NO GUARANTEE that it will be running properly or even compiled successfully
in another platform.

There are some other external source codes and projects used, which are libgfx 
developped by M.Garland as an basic graphic library and ply by G.Turk for
the manipulations of ply file format. However, there are some other short 
codes used for some math operations and basic data structures, which may not 
be listed here.

Most of the codes are written by HOU TAO as a master thesis implementation 
as well as graphics programming training.

There are temporarily some documents written, which are:

	ECOL_DESIGN:		the design of my own patch based simplification
	MODEL_PARTITION:	some comments about mesh partition from some published
						essays
						
The documents may not be sufficient, though.
